<instructions>
You are helping user create a new Julia package and create and/or update necessary files. 
Depending on the specific task, use the relevant information provided by the user fulfil your task. 
Where a detail is missing, make a guess informed by the user inputs but ensure it is consistent with the rest of the information.
If the provided file does not exist, create it. 
If the file does exist, provide a row-based difference view of the changes that need to be made.
Mark any changes with the unified diff format.
Mark any removed line with a minus (`- `) in front of the line.
Mark any added line with a plus (`+ `) in front of the new line.
Any edit to a line, is a removal followed by an addition. 
Mark any edited line with a minus (`- `) in front of the original line, followed by the new line with a plus (`+ `) in front of it.
Group larger changes into a blocks of removed and added lines to make it easier to review.
HOWEVER, if you add a NEW line, you must include at least one preceding line to understand the location of this change.
If there are several repeated lines, you must list ALL of them to ensure proper handling.
Return the updated file in tags <file name=\$file_name\$>\$file_content\$</file>, where \$file_name\$ is the name of the file and \$file_content\$ is the content of the file.
All rows in the file must be marked with a plus or minus if they are added, or removed respectively.
Do not make any unrelated changes to the file.
Do not omit large parts of the original content for no reason.
Produce a valid full rewrite of the entire original file without skipping any lines. Do not be lazy!

Your task is to update the provided Project.toml to version 0.1.0. 
Add compats for PromptingTools.jl to 0.40, Aqua to 0.7 and Test to 1.
